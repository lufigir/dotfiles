  Architecture for a product. **Bootstrap** starts one from zero (framing, scope, ERD, layered
  folders, lint guardrails, a vertical slice); **Convention** keeps its rules holding mid-build. Use
  when starting or scaffolding a project, and whenever work touches where a file goes or what a
  layer may import, schema and migrations, multi-tenancy, data access (Supabase and RLS included),
  APIs, background jobs, uploads, security, performance, observability, URLs, list screens, forms,
  lint boundaries, accessibility, analytics and feature flags, personal data, or choosing the
  architecture style or the database. Spanish triggers: "proyecto nuevo", "alcance", "dónde va este
  archivo", "en qué capa", "cómo modelo esta tabla", "migración", "tabla con filtros",

# Project architecture

The first hour of a project decides whether it scales. Folders are the easy part; the hard part is **ownership**: who is allowed to know about what. A codebase where the UI can reach Stripe, or where `page.tsx` calls the ORM directly, does not get better with time. It gets bigger.

This matters more with coding agents than without them. An agent reads the conventions already in the repo and builds on top of them. Bad structure does not stay bad at constant size; it compounds. Set the boundaries first and the agent's shortcuts become impossible rather than merely discouraged.

Which is why this skill has a second job. Conventions decided in week one are forgotten by week six, by the agent whose context has rolled over and by the human who moved on. **Bootstrap** builds the architecture. **Convention** keeps it.

## Pick the mode

| Situation | Mode |
|---|---|
| Nothing exists yet, or only bare framework CLI output | [Bootstrap](#bootstrap) |
| A project already exists and work is happening inside it | [Convention](#convention) |

## Everything version-specific is a moving target

`references/` holds distilled architecture knowledge: layering, the dependency rule, DAL/DTO/policy, ERD design and migrations, tenant isolation, API contracts, list views, mutations, accessibility, async work, uploads, security, performance, operations, product analytics, privacy, lint guardrails and design tokens. Those **principles** hold across versions.

**Every concrete API, file name, flag, and command in them is a moving target.** The reference files mark those with `VERIFY:` blocks stating exactly what to look up. Resolve them against the live docs before writing code, in **both** modes, not just at bootstrap. Context7 goes through Executor; see the `mcp-integrations` skill for the tool path and the two-step flow. Read the version attached to whatever comes back: it is the difference between "the docs say X" and "the docs for the version installed here say X".

Never write code from what a reference file, or your training data, *implies* the current API is. Live example: Next.js renamed `middleware` to `proxy`, and now ships its own docs inside `node_modules/next/docs`. Anything that hardcoded those is already wrong.

When the live docs contradict a reference file, **the docs win** and you say so out loud. If a reference file's *principle* no longer has a mechanism in the current version, say that too rather than inventing one.

## The non-negotiables

The compressed form of the rules, for recall. Each one expands in the reference file named; that file is the authority.

Five are conditional and say so. 3, 10 and 16 hold only when their concern is in the project's scope (`problem-framing.md`). 6 and 8 name the mechanism of a React framework with server components; on another stack keep the principle and find its mechanism there, or say it has none (`maintenance.md`). The rest hold in every project, because they are how the code is built rather than what it builds.

1. **The dependency rule.** UI → Transport → Domain → Capabilities → Vendors, each layer reaching only the one below it. Shared contracts and the database client flow upward to everyone. (`architecture.md`)
2. **The DAL is the only path to the database.** No ORM call in a page, a component, a route handler, or an action. (`data-layer.md`)
3. **In a multi-tenant product, the tenant is a required argument.** Never optional, never inherited, never taken from a client-controlled value. This covers jobs, caches and storage keys, not just queries. (`multi-tenancy.md`)
4. **Authorization before data, next to the data.** Upstream gates are an optimization, not the security model. (`data-layer.md`)
5. **Validate in and out.** Inputs because users lie; outputs because the database returns more than the client should see. (`data-layer.md`)
6. **Server-only is a build error, not a convention.** On a stack with server components, sensitive modules import the server-only marker so a client import fails loudly. (`security.md`)
7. **Every entry point is public.** A server action compiles to a POST endpoint; arriving through your form is not a fact you get to assume. (`security.md`)
8. **On a server-component stack, Server Components by default.** `"use client"` lives on the leaves, only where there is interactivity. (`performance.md`)
9. **One contract, both directions.** The schema is the single source of truth for input, output, types and docs. (`api-design.md`)
10. **In a list view, the state lives in the URL.** Filters, sort, search and page are query params, parsed against a schema. State trapped in a component is a view nobody can share, bookmark or restore. (`list-views.md`)
11. **A boundary that is not linted is a preference.** The dependency rule is only real once an illegal import fails the build. (`lint-guardrails.md`)
12. **A URL that has been shared is a contract.** Do not encode a movable relationship in a path, and never let a rename silently kill existing links. (`url-design.md`)
13. **The right element before any ARIA.** Native elements carry role, focus and keyboard behavior; a div reimplementing them is a permanent debt. Focus and announcements are owned, not assumed. (`accessibility.md`)
14. **Semantic tokens, never literal colors.** `bg-primary`, not `bg-blue-500`. (`design-system.md`)
15. **One naming format.** kebab-case for source files, snake_case in the database. (`architecture.md`, `database.md`)
16. **When the product measures usage, events are a contract.** Declared once in a typed catalog, never named from a variable; business events captured on the server after the write commits; the analytics vendor behind a capability like any other. (`product-analytics.md`)

## Bootstrap

The five phases (discovery, version verification, blueprint, scaffold, verify) live in `bootstrap.md`. Read it whole before the first question to the user: the order of the phases is the point, and phase 3 stops for approval before anything is scaffolded.

## Convention

The failure this mode exists to prevent: an agent six weeks in, writing a query straight into a page component because nothing in its context said not to.

### Order of authority

1. **`AGENTS.md` at the repo root.** This is the project's own record: resolved versions, layer names, the illegal imports, the domain vocabulary, where a new feature goes. Read it before answering anything architectural.
2. **The code already there.** One existing module of the same kind outranks any general rule. Copy its shape.
3. **`references/`.** The principle behind the rule, and the answer when the repo is silent.

When the repo contradicts a reference file, **the repo wins** and you say so. A project that deliberately diverged is not a project that made a mistake. When the repo is silent, apply the reference and offer to write the decision into `AGENTS.md`.

### The procedure

0. **Audit first when you are new to the repo.** `python <skill>/scripts/audit_project.py --path .` gives you, in one pass, which non-negotiables are in place and which are not. Cheaper than reading twenty-four references to find out the project never had lint boundaries.
1. **Read `AGENTS.md`, the Scope first.** If there is none, say so: the project has no written conventions, and writing one is usually the highest-value next move. Per `references/architecture.md`. If there is no Scope section, run the scope study from `references/problem-framing.md` before recommending any concern the project may never have chosen.
2. **Check the concern against the scope.** Work that would build a concern marked **later** or **no** is a scope change: stop, say so, and update the Scope row with the user before applying that reference.
3. **Name the layer.** Answer "who should be allowed to know about this?" before "where does this file go?". The layer decides the folder, not the other way around.
4. **Open the one reference for the concern**, not all twenty-four. The table below maps concern to file.
5. **Resolve the `VERIFY:` blocks that apply** against the live docs before writing any code. A principle that is right and an API that is stale still produces a broken file.
6. **Point at the closest existing example** in the repo and match it: naming, file split, order of operations inside the function.

### When the question is not this skill's

One question arrives dressed as an architecture question and is answered better elsewhere. Hand it over instead of improvising:

| The question actually is | Skill | Why not here |
|---|---|---|
| "This is broken", "this got slow", a failing behaviour with no obvious cause | `diagnosing-bugs` | An architecture answer to a bug report is a guess. That skill starts from a reproduction and does not stop at the first plausible story |

### Keeping `AGENTS.md` alive

A convention that only lives in this skill is a convention the next session loses. When work establishes something durable (a new layer, a chosen library, a rule you had to explain twice), write it into `AGENTS.md` in the same change. Keep `CLAUDE.md` a pointer at `AGENTS.md`; two copies of the conventions means one of them is stale.

## Reference files

Read the one the work is about. Reading all twenty-four for a question about a foreign key wastes the context the actual task needs.
